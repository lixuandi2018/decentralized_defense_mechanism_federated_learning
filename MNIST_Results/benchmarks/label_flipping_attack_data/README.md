- **Purpose:** Explaining the CSV file format and experimentation data for plot generation.
- **Target Collaborator:** Dr. Dimitris Chatzopoulos
- **Concerned Files:** 2_test_accuracy_results.csv, overall_test_accuracy_results.csv

## Files Content Summary:

- **2_test_accuracy_results.csv** -> Contains the testing accuracy of the model when predicting '2' (THE FLIPPED LABEL) under settings with different number of malicious agents.
- **overall_test_accuracy_results.csv** -> Contains the overall testing accuracy of the model under settings with different number of malicious agents. 

## Files Structure:

- **2_test_accuracy_results.csv** -> pretty self-exlanatory based on the labels. do contact me in case of any doubt/query. 

- **overall_test_accuracy_results.csv** -> pretty self-explanatory based on the labels. do contact me in case of any doubt/query.

## Intended Graphs:


- **Figure 2** on FedClean Overleaf, i.e. Overall Testing Accuracy in presence of 0 to 30 agents after 50 rounds of training in 2 setting. 1) Natural (no defence) federated learning 2) FedClean (defence).

**NOTE** We don't have any data for FedClean accuracy for now, so just make a bar graph for one. We will add a combined comparison graph once we have a data for both.
