## FedClean: A Decentralized Defense Mechanism Against Parameter Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning Systems

- The repository contains the federated learning and blockchain experimentation code written for the conference paper <b>FedClean: A Decentralized Defense Mechanism Against Parameter Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning Systems</b>. As the code was purely used for experiments, the pipeline isn't fully connected and it requires a lot of modifications and cleaning. As the paper is already submitted, I will do it at some point in future, but if anyone's interested in contributing,
    please reach out to me and we can discuss. :)
